# Big-Data-Analytics-for-Fraud-Detection
Big Data Analytics (BDA) is transformative in identifying financial and accounting fraud, and it is a solution to the shortcomings of the conventional traditional rule-based and manual audit approaches. Using an extensive literature review and a quantitative analysis of more than 500,000 anonymized credit card transactions, the study compares methods of BDA, such as machine learning, predictive analytics, anomaly detection, and natural language processing. The findings prove that BDA models (random forests and artificial neural networks) have better accuracy (as high as 99.1), precision, and recall than those of the traditional methods, which were as low as 0.5000 in terms of accuracy. The models that performed most well in detection of known and emerging fraud patterns were hybrid models that combined supervised and unsupervised methods. Challenges like data silos, legacy systems, and algorithmic bias necessitate robust data governance and infrastructure upgrades. According to the study, the hybrid BDA models, increased data integration, and the promotion of ethical AI should be taken up to make fraud detection stronger, minimize losses, and improve the resilience of financial systems.
